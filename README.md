This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


## Favorite feature

Each album displayed has a `love` icon button on it. Clicking on this icon sets that particular album as a favorite and adds them to a favorite list.

You can see a counter at the top Navigation component which indicates how many albums have been made favorite.

Clicking on the icon on the top shows you your favorite list along with the details of all your favorite albums.

You can also remove an album from your favorite list by either clicking on the `X` button next to the album on the favorite list or on the main page toggling the `love` icon on the original card of the album.
